  - answers to academic honesty questions (see below)
  - My code works exactly as specified in the lab. No further functionalities were implemented, and none of the code is non-working code.
  
The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is
working or not.  You may also want to include anything else you would
like to communicate to the grader such as extra functionalities you
implemented or how you tried to fix your non-working code.

Please answer the academic honesty questions.

[1][ANSWER] No, I would not constitute this as cheating as the tutor is NOT providing you explicitly with code. However, the tutor should not point directly at the wrong code, as I would consider this as cheating. As long as the tutor is not being explicit, I would not consider this cheating.
[2][ANSWER] Yes, I would constitute this as cheating because you are receiving explicit code with correct answers. This is cheat code.
[3][ANSWER] Yes this constitutes as cheating as you have access to the answers that are not yours within your possesion.
[4][a][ANSWER] No, asking for clarification on topics from lecture do not constitute as cheating, as this is asking for help with conceptual material unrelated to lab answers/clarifications. 
[4][b] [ANSWER] No, If you are explaining a conceptual idea of their code, I would not consider this cheating because you are not exchanging any code. However, if any code is exchanged or copied in this process, I would consider this cheating.
[4][c][ANSWER]No, If no code is exchanged, I would not consider this cheating. Asking for an overall idea of the lab without code is something I would consider conceptual and not explicit.
[5][ANSWER] No, this is not cheating TO A CERTAIN DEGREE! If you are directly copying, this IS cheating. If you are using it as a skeleton situation and CITE YOUR SOURCE, then this is not necessarily cheating. However, this is a very fine line and overall would not encourage in any light, but if you do use Google, yu must cite it or this is cheating.
[6][ANSWER] No, this is not cheating. Looking up errors helps you debug and as long as it does not explicitly fix your code, it is okay to look up an error number/ error pop up as sometimes they are not explicit and do not provide the actual nature of the error. 
[7][ANSWER] Yes, copying code and solutions of any amount IS cheating, not matter how it is used/condensed.
